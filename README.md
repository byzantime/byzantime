### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Most of the work gets done [using Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/byzantine) - but GitHub seems more convenient as a profile.

## Projects!

This is what I've been working on most actively, recently:

* [Remotely.nz](Remotely.nz?utm_source=github&utm_medium=profile) A remote job board listing work for people in New Zealand.
* [BuyVsRent.co.nz](https://buyvsrent.co.nz) A calculator that helps answer the age-old question.  There's also a [UK version of the same site](https://buyvsrent.co.uk).
* [RentalYieldCalculator.co.uk](https://rentalyieldcalculator.co.uk?utm_source=github&utm_medium=profile) - a handy little calculator for displaying the expected annual yield for a rental property.
* A little page which predicts [the best date / time this week to go swimming in Torquay](https://torquaytide.co.uk/) (Devon, England!).  The page is generated by a small Python script; the script calls tidal and weather APIs and uses Jinja to render an HTML page.  The page is then served up by Netlify.
* [16GoingOn17.com](https://16goingon17.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=profile) - for all The Sound of Music fans out there.
