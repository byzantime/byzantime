### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Most of my repos end up on Gitlab - but GitHub seems more convenient as a profile.

## Projects!

This is what I've been working on most actively, recently:

* A little page which predicts [the best date / time this week to go swimming in Torquay](https://super-pastelito-fa54f0.netlify.app/) (Devon, England!).  The page is generated by a small Python script; the script calls tidal and weather APIs and uses Jinja to render an HTML page.  The page is then served up by Netlify.
* [RentalYieldCalculator.co.uk](https://rentalyieldcalculator.co.uk) - a handy little calculator for displaying the expected annual yield for a rental property.
